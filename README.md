Additive Cymatics Animator
======
**The Cymatics Animator** is a python script for producing video files of progressive additive synthesis, demonstrating the audiovisual effect of the Fourier Theorem. Sine waves, representing the harmonics of a fundamental frequency, are gradually added one-by-one, until a final waveform is created. 

Waveform shapes include:
- Sawtooth (Even and Odd Harmonics)
- Square (Only Odd Harmonics)

With options to select:
- Fundamental Frequency
- Summation Speed
- Number of Harmonics to Add
- Output Directory
